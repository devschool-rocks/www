Everybody has their reasons. So we thought this might be a good opportunity to give you 8 great reasons why you should chose Devschool as your online dev bootcamp.

We think we are fairly unique in a cluttered space of mediocrity. At the very least, we value our Customers a little more and give them more personal attention than the "big box" dev bootcamps.

## 1. Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.

Devschool focuses on the quality of our students, not the quantity. We keep the enrollments artificially low to make sure that every Student gets the most from their Instructor. Due to the lack of artificial separations between you and your classmates (there are no cohorts here) everyone enrolled knows everyone else. 

At Devschool we refuse to make many of the mistakes we feel the "big box" developer bootcamps make, and we think overselling your product so the amount of quality time between Student and Instructor is strained, is a terrible idea. At no time will an Instructor take on more than 10 students at a time, versus the 12-24 we see elsewhere.


## 2. Devschool has "elastic" pacing" so you don't fall behind in your education.

Life happens, and the speed in which it happens is out of our control. That is why Devschool switched from a rigid 3 option pacing system similar to the competition to the more fluid version we have now. Each month you and your Instructor schedule your upcoming appointments.

The number of appointments you take a week directly correlates to the number of self development time you need to commit to. That is the time you spend building your application on your own, or with a friend thanks to our "self assembling teams" policy.

If you won't be able to make an appointment previously set just give us as much notice as possible. Again, our goal is to be as flexible as possible, so you don't lose a private session you miss.


## 3. We are an expert tooling, science and measurements kind of web development bootcamp

We don't train mediocre developers at Devschool, we train GREAT developers at Devschool. This starts with the gated enrollment process to check for both culture and ability, and it extends to our course material and choice of tools, which is purposefully chosen to be what the experts use.

There are two 'schools' of thought on web development. Some thing it should be a blue collar 'whilly-nilly' 'non-engineery' - that is not us. We take the engineering approach to our code and our teaching and we use real metrics and the scientific method to back it up.


## 4. Only at Devschool do you get up to 6-8 hours of time with your Instructor

At some of the online developer bootcamp programs you get 1-2 45 minute sessions with your Instructor a week and that is all. Not at Devschool. You have a direct life-line to your Instructor via Flowdock chat 10am-5pm Monday-Thursday and there is one Instructor-led group session daily.

That means you can have a total of 6-8 hours of pair programming time with your Instructor a week vs the 1 and a half or so you get elsewhere! In the real world, software is built by teams, and so we believe in building a strong culture of team and a strong culture of communication.


## 5. We don't just build web developers, we train teams to work together

Nothing gets done in a vacuum, and rarely do you work alone as a professional web developer, even if you go the self employed contractor route. Since at Devschool we model the real world when possible, we cultivate a strong sense of team, it helps you stay motivated, and it gives you the experience of working with others as a team.

We have a policy of "Self Assembled Teams" which is a fancy way of saying, come together and work together when you can, when you see fit, and when you feel like doing so. There is no pressure in pair programming here at Devschool. By not forcing peer programming, Students "self assemble" and decide it is more engaging and fun to pair up with people they like.


## 6. We don't just train you, we put you to work on real projects for real non-profits and NGOs

Building canned applications from a step by step guide is only so useful and interesting, and they benefit no one but you, which isn't very social! So we prefer to get you working on code to impact someone's life as soon as possible!

This also gets you in front of prospective employers before you even graduate, and make connections that will go with you long after you graduate Devschool and start spending those big paychecks. And since the companies in this program are also

NGO or non-profit, your work could literally put a homeless family in a home! Now put THAT on your résumé!


## 7. We have an excellent refund policy and we aren't afraid to use it

Should you decide that programming isn't for you or should life rear it's ugly head and kick you in the ass and you want to drop out of the program we will refund you a pro-rated amount minus the non refundable portion which you can read about in our [terms of service](https://devschool.rocks/terms) page.

If at some point in the future you decide to restart your education, maybe you won the lottery, maybe Grandma gave you some Benjamins, or maybe you got your old job back - you can repay what you were refunded and save yourself a bunch of hard-gotten cashola and return where you left off. NO other online developer bootcamp does that! Did I mention we are flexible?


## 8. You could spend you last two weeks of school in Puerto Vallarta for free!

Everyone who is close to graduating is encouraged to spend their final two weeks here in our community housing in sunny, warm, friendly, Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Best of all, the Mexican Government loves tourists so much they subsidize airfare here which is why it is usually less than $500 USD to fly down from the continental USA. Canadian and World based Students are welcome too!

There is no charge from Devschool to take place in this program, you just need yourself a valid Passport and as round trip plane ticket. We can arrange for your arrival when you are ready to come on down!
