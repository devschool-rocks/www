        <h2>Free Weekend Online Coding Bootcamp</h2>

        <p>Devschool LOVES TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE! And to that end every other weekend,
        we will host a free hour code lesson and open the doors to the Devschool
        experience. It's a great way to learn some cool skills and meet some of
        of the current students!</p>

        <p>We don't know very far ahead of time when we are available to teach these
        but if you put your email on the list, we will let you know a few days before
        one happens!</p>
