        <p>My instructor Jim was the best programming teacher I have had. He is fun, easy going, and when things get hard he doesn't mind repeating a concept until you get the point, and I learned a lot from him that my bootcamp missed.</p>
        <p>Devschool not only helped me learn the skills I would need day to day, Jim also helped me prepare for the interview! I highly recommend Devschool!</p>

        <p>There will be times when you feel 'dumb' or overwhelmed. That is completely
        normal. Jim is here to make the process as painless as possible, like going
        dungeon crawling with a high level friend who can protect you and shine a
        light in your direction when you are stuck.</p>

        <p>But it doesn't have to be painful. The only time you are forced to pair with anyone
        specifically will be with your instructor. The rest of the pair programming you will do
        will be on "self assembling teams"</p>

        <p>Your homework will be to continue working on your application in between sessions
        with Jim. During that time you will learn to master your searching skills to pluck out 
        the information you want from the mass of noise out there.</p>
