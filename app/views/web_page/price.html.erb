      <h2>Devschool Online Developer Bootcamp - The PRICE FAQ</h2>

      <p>Devschool's online developer bootcamp is priced based on some simple
      factors. We have a small company staff, a very modest Headquarters in affordable
      Puerto Vallarta, Mexico (come visit us!), and the number of hours you meet
      personally with your Instructor.</p>

      <h3>Q. What is the complete price of the course?</h3>

      <p>A. $4,988 USD covers everything if you pay up-front.</p>

      <h3>Q. What is the cost if I need to make payments?</h3>

      <p>A. If you choose to make payments instead of paying up front you agree
      to make 6 payments of $998 USD, which is $5,988 USD.</p>

      <h3>Q. How are payments processed, do you have my Credit Card number?</h3>

      <p>A. All payments are handled by our partner, <a rel=nofollow href="https://stripe.com">
        Stripe</a> and at no time do we ever store any of your credit card details on
      our servers or in our databases. We take your financial security seriously.</p>

      <h3>Q. If I go with payments when will they be due each month?</h3>

      <p>A. That depends on the day you pay initially. You will be billed on the same
      day each month until your balanced is settled. Well unless you sign on a leap day :)</p>

      <h3>Q. What if I decide to get a refund?</h3>

      <p>A. We have refunded a couple of Students so far, but it was always a financial
      burden they were facing not due to our performance. You can get a refund as per the
      <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

      <p>In most cases Students put their education on hold and were able to resume again
      after the crisis passed by paying back the money they refunded and picking up where
      they left off. We pride ourselves in being Human first and flexible.</p>
