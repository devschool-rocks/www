<p>At Devschool I learned the skills that I needed to land the job I 
have today. I completed my Web Development course in 18 weeks as 
I had other obligations and Devschool was flexible enough for me to 
handle both!</p>
<p>I would recommend the Web Developers course at Devschool to anyone 
who wants to cut through the cruft and really, really learn the skills 
they will need to build modern web applications.</p>

Our job at Devschool is not to just teach you web development, but
to also get you a job in the web development field. In order to get a job
you must have first had one. It can be a vicious cycle of No.

We have found that it is a lot easier to build experience with Non Profits
as they are more apt to work with Jr Developers who have enthusiasm for the
mission.

Gaining that initial team experience and referrals is a critical step
to becoming a paid web developer, and Devschool's NGO Parter Program is
designed to do exactly that.

No, the interning hours that you do as part of your school work is
not paid work in the sense that you get money. You will however get valuable
experience and some people in your corner backing you when you look for you
real job.
