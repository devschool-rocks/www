      <p>My instructor Jim was the best programming teacher I have had. He is fun, easy going, and when things get hard he doesn't mind repeating a concept until you get the point, and I learned a lot from him that my bootcamp missed.</p>
      <p>Devschool not only helped me learn the skills I would need day to day, Jim also helped me prepare for the interview! I highly recommend Devschool!</p>

        <p class="tailline">Your Instructor is here to make the process as painless as possible, like going
        dungeon crawling with a high level friend who can protect you and shine a

        specifically will be with your instructor. The rest of the pair programming you will do
        will be on "self assembling teams"</p>

        <h2>Where do the students of this coding bootcamp meet? - FAQ</h2>

        <p>Devschool is an online coding bootcamp and we are accessible
        to North and South America as well as Europe and even Australia and New Zealand!
        Our remote nature matches the world of software development well and it allows us
        to have amazing students from around the globe!</p>

        <h3>Q. So we meet online, how does that work?</h3>

        <p>A. Devschool utilizes a mixture of technologies to accomplish a "connected"
        environment and culture for our Students. This is not like Udemy where you
        feel like you are in it alone. We promote a very social atmosphere.</p>

        <p>We use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.flowdock.com/">Flowdock</a> for
        our chat program, but it is really so much more then that! It allows contextual
        conversations so what you are talking about doesn't get mixed up with other
        people's messages that have nothing to do with what you are saying.</p>

        <h3>Q. What about screen-sharing? How does that work exactly?</h3>

        <p>A. We use a program called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> 
        to broadcast our private and group sessions.
        This allows the Instructor to share his screen and work and demonstrate things
        with live lessons, or to switch over to a student's machine and fix something
        for them.</p>

        <p>It works best with Mac but there is a version for Linux as well.</p>

        <h3>Q. How can we see our Instructor's calendar?</h3>

        <p>You will be given a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://teamup.com">Teamup Calendar</a>
        link and will be able to view the calendar online whenever
        you need it. You can even import it into whatever calendar program you 
        already use! Each month you and your Instructor will choose your private
        session schedule and those appointments will show up in that calendar.</p>

        <p>If you need to cancel or reschedule it is never a problem, just let your
        Instructor know with as much notice as possible and they will reschedule it.</p>

  <p class="well next">Awesome, we meet online so I can attend from virtually anywhere! <%= link_to "How much does this program cost?", price_path %></p>
