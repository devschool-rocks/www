        <p>My instructor Jim was the best programming teacher I have had. He is fun, easy going, and when things get hard he doesn't mind repeating a concept until you get the point, and I learned a lot from him that my bootcamp missed.</p>
        <p>Devschool not only helped me learn the skills I would need day to day, Jim also helped me prepare for the interview! I highly recommend Devschool!</p>

      <h2>Devschool Online Developer Bootcamp - The WHERE FAQ</h2>

      <p>Devschool is an online developer web developer bootcamp and we are accessible
      to North and South America as well as Europe and even Australia and New Zealand!
      Our remote nature matches the world of software development well and it allows us
      to have amazing students from around the globe!</p>

      <h3>Q. So we meet online, how does that work?</h3>

      <p>A. Devschool utilizes a mixture of technologies to accomplish a "connected"
      environment and culture for our Students. This is not like Udemy where you
      feel like you are in it alone. We promote a very social atmosphere.</p>

      <p>We use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.flowdock.com/">Flowdock</a> for
      our chat program, but it is really so much more then that! It allows contextual
      conversations so what you are talking about doesn't get mixed up with other
      people's messages that have nothing to do with what you are saying.</p>

      <h3>Q. What about screensharing? How does that work exactly?</h3>

      <p>A. We use a program called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> 
      to broadcast our private and group sessions.
      This allows the Instructor to share his screen and work and demonstrate things
      with live lessons, or to switch over to a student's machine and fix something
      for them.</p>

      <p>It works best with Mac but there is a version for Linux as well.</p>

      <h3>Q. How can we see our Instructor's calendar?</h3>

      <p>You will be given a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://teamup.com">Teamup Calendar</a>
      link and will be able to view the calendar online whenever
      you need it. You can even import it into whatever calendar program you 
      already use! Each month you and your Instructor will choose your private
      session schedule and those appointments will show up in that calendar.</p>

      <p>If you need to cancel or reschedule it is never a problem, just let your
      Instructor know with as much notice as possible and they will reschedule it.</p>
