        <h2>How we teach - FAQ</h2>

        <p>Learning a new skill is difficult but exciting. Programming and especially
        web development - probably doubly so. It requires you learning a half dozen
        new languages, retraining your brain to think in abstractions, and absorbing
        a constantly changing catalog of tools and advancements.</p>

        <p>The curriculum and method we use at our online coding bootcamp was designed
        to have a maximum impact on our students learning experience. Everything you
        will learn at Devschool will be the same things you do at your real job.</p>

        <h3>Q. What is the Devschool Curriculum? Is it step by step?</h3>

        <p>A. Our coding bootcamp focuses on the DOING part of learning. There is no step A,
        step B, step C, prescribed ahead of time in the real world, and since at our
        core, we are an Agile organization, we have no time for things pulled from our
        own rear ends. We like organical solutions, not contrived examples.</p>

        <p>You are going to be learning to build web applications. What better way
        then to do it by building web applications, but not some clone of something
        you aren't interested in. Instead you will select (with the help of your
        Instructor) a topic that interests you, and then you will build a web app
        related to that.</p>

        <p>Also while learning to become a web developer here at Devschool's online bootcamp
        program you will do REAL work on REAL applications on the REAL interwebs
        for a <%= link_to "REAL Non Profit Organization", ngo_path %>!</p>

        <h3>Q. How do I work with my Devchool Instructor?</h3>

        <p>A. You will work directly with your Instructor to plan your web application
        in the exact same way you would once you are working in the 'Real World', 
        figuring out the point of it, what features will it have, how would those
        interfaces would actually look.</p>

        <p>Each week you will meet with your Instructor via Zoom (https://zoom.us)
        via screen sharing and audio chat. You can broadcast your video if you like,
        but usually we just do a photo instead of video so your hair can be messy
        or you can learn in your pajamas, whatever floats your boat.</p>

        <p>The number of times you will meet with your instructor weekly is between
        the two of you, and is scheduled a month in advance. This allows you to adapt
        your learning experience based on your own "real world" events and timelines.</p>

        <h3>Q. What about self study hours? What will I learn on my own?</h3>

        <p>A. There are a total of 420 hours in the curriculum. Only 40 of those are 
        one on one with your Instructor. The rest is a combination of Group Sessions
        or as we call them #OpenSessions, and self study hours, in which you hack
        on your app and the learning takes whatever twists and turns it needs as your
        needs change.</p>

        <h3>Q. What about learning in a group setting?</h3>

        <p>A. Group sessions are available at least once a day, five days a week,
        and are led by your Instructor. These sessions are live coding sessions. It
        is participation pair programming in the sense that if you are following
        along and you understand the material, shout out answers. Challenge your
        Instructor's code. Don't quite yet know what is going on? Stay quiet and
        watch it all unfold.</p>

        <h3>Q. What about Pair Programming? Do you teach that at Devschool?</h3>

        <p>A. Yes we do! Pair programming happens by the process we call "Self Assembling
        Teams" which just means, be as engaged with each other as your comfort
        allows. We think pair programming is powerful and awesome, but not everyone
        wants to pair all the time.</p>

        <p>Devschool's online coding bootcamp is meant to fit a large number of
        people with different backgrounds and sitations, Some students like to 
        work with others a lot, some like to work alone mostly. We teach you to
        work both ways and give you options!</p>

        <h3>Q. Can I record the group and private sessions to rewatch later?</h3>

        <p>A. Absolutely! In fact we recommend that you create a folder at the very
        beginning of the course and save a recording of every session you attend
        there for later viewing. It is like having your own personal coding bootcamp
        screencast series!</p>

        <h3>Q. What if I don't know what I want to focus on?</h3>

        <p>A. Maybe the application you want to build will naturally lend itself to a 
        heavy JavaScript interface, creating a very interactive experience. Maybe it
        will be more MBA related and have lots of forms in which to enter data, or
        maybe something more like a marketplace with money changing hands.</p>

        <p>One of the greatest strengths of the curriculum at our coding bootcamp is it's
        ability to adapt based on the interests and needs of each student. Not everyone
        wants to build the same five web applications to learn.
