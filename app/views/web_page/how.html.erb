        <p>At Devschool I learned the skills that I needed to land the job I 
        have today. I completed my Web Development course in 18 weeks as 
        I had other obligations and Devschool was flexible enough for me to 
        handle both!</p>

        <p>I would recommend the Web Developers course at Devschool to anyone 
        who wants to cut through the cruft and really, really learn the skills 
        they will need to build modern web applications.</p>

      <h2>So how exactly does the Devschool online bootcamp teach web development?</h2>

      <p>Learning a new skill is difficult but exciting. Programming and especially
      web development - probably doubly so. It requires you learning a half dozen
      new languages, retraining your brain to think in abstractions, and absorbing
      a constantly changing catalog of tools and advancements.</p>

      <p>At Devschool we focus on the DOING part of learning. There is no step A,
      step B, step C, prescribed ahead of time in the real world, and since at our
      core, we are an Agile organization, we have no time for things pulled from our
      own rear ends. We like organical solutions, not contrived examples.</p>

      <h3>Lofty words there amigo. What the hell does that mean?</h3>

      <p>You are going to be learning to build web applications. What better way
      then to do it by building web applications, but not some clone of something
      you aren't interested in. Instead you will select (with the help of your
      Instructor) a topic that interests you, and then you will build a web app
      related to that.</p>

      <p>You will work directly with your Instructor to plan your web application
      in the exact same way you would once you are working in the 'Real World', 
      figuring out the point of it, what features will it have, how would those
      interfaces would actually look.</p>

      <h3>So I meet with my Instructor to talk, how does that work?</h3>

      <p>Each week you will meet with your Instructor via Zoom (https://zoom.us)
      via screen sharing and audio chat. You can broadcast your video if you like,
      but usually we just do a photo instead of video so your hair can be messy
      or you can learn in your pajamas, whatever floats your boat.</p>

      <p>The number of times you will meet with your instructor weekly is between
      the two of you, and is scheduled a month in advance. This allows you to adapt
      your learning experience based on your own "real world" events and timelines.</p>

      <h3>What about self study hours? What will I learn on my own?</h3>

      <p>There are a total of 420 hours in the curriculum. Only 40 of those are 
      one on one with your Instructor. The rest is a combination of Group Sessions
      or as we call them #OpenSessions, and self study hours, in which you hack
      on your app and the learning takes whatever twists and turns it needs as your
      needs change.</p>

      <p>The #OpenSessions are available at least once a day, five days a week,
      and are led by your Instructor. These sessions are live coding sessions. It
      is participation pair programming in the sense that if you are following
      along and you understand the material, shout out answers. Challenge your
      Instructor's code. Don't quite yet know what is going on? Stay quiet and
      watch it all unfold.</p>

      <h3>Can I record these live #Private and #OpenSessions?</h3>

      <p>Absolutely! In fact we recommend that you create a folder at the very
      beginning of the course and save a recording of every session you attend
      there for later viewing. It is like having your own personal programming
      screencast series!</p>

      <h3>What is the curriculum then?</h3>

      <p>There is no spoon. No front-end and back-end. There is just web applications.
      Maybe the application you want to build will naturally lend itself to a 
      heavy JavaScript interface, creating a very interactive experience. Maybe it
      will be more MBA related and have lots of forms in which to enter data, or
      maybe something more like a marketplace with money changing hands.</p>

      <p>Your curriculum is literrally decided by the applications you build.</p>
