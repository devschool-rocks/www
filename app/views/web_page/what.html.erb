            height: "100px", width: "200px"%>
        <p>These are programs known as "shells" and they allow you to interact with a computer via the "Terminal".
        While both provide scripting capability, we at Devschool find ZSH to be more useful and it is the recommended shell here.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <%= image_tag image_path("git-heading.png"), class: "img-responsive center-block",
            height: "100px", width: "200px"%>
        <p>We can use Git to secure our files against loss or corruption, for working on experimental
        branches, for tracking changes made by other developers, and merging it all back together for deployment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <%= image_tag image_path("postgres-mongo-heading.png"), class: "img-responsive center-block",
            height: "100px", width: "200px"%>
        <p>When data must be stored (which is basically all the time), a database is needed to store and retrive that data
        At Devschool we primarily focus on tried and true Postgresql and then show you newer formats like Mongo.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <%= image_tag image_path("vim-heading.png"), class: "img-responsive center-block",
            height: "100px", width: "200px"%>
        <p>Vim is some super-secret sauce. Not only does it make you look like a wizard while you are creating and editing files (which by 
        the way is 90% of your new life as a web developer!) but it also is built to be a very powerful, efficient tool.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <%= image_tag image_path("osx-heading.png"), class: "img-responsive center-block",
            height: "100px", width: "200px"%>
        <p>We LOVE Macs here at Devschool. This is not an accident. Not only are they stunningly beautiful machines for doing computer
        work on, but they are built on UNIX, which is the basis of all those "servers" out there serving up the interwebs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <%= image_tag image_path("linux-heading.png"), class: "img-responsive center-block",
            height: "100px", width: "200px"%>
        <p>We LOVE Linux at the Devschool! Similar to OSX, it is built on the solid core of the UNIX operating system, providing a robust,
        secure platform to build software like that of the web. If you need a budget machine to attend Devschool, look no further than Linux.</p>

        <p>HTML is the heart and soul of the web. It is the foundation on which all the other languages and technologies revolve around.
        It is a rich markup language, and with the recent implementation of HTML5, new possibilities of integrating media and the web are better than ever!</p>

        <%= image_tag image_path("css-heading.png"), class: "img-responsive center-block",

        <p>Without CSS the web would be a dull and drab place indeed! Is is these Cascading Style Sheets that provide all of the color, margin, and fonts
        to your favorite websites. It also enables multiple screen sizes and configurations to display custom versions of the content formatted for the display.</p>

        <%= image_tag image_path("javascript-heading.png"), class: "img-responsive center-block",
            height: "100px", width: "200px"%>
        <p>Javascript is the only language embedded in every browser on the planet. It is the mechanism by which content is changed, loaded, sorted, or otherwise
        animated. It provides a common browser based platform to build truely interactive web applications that act more like a desktop app than a web app.</p>

        <p>Bootstrap is a framework created by Twitter to provide an easy mechanism to render complex content to a web browser no matter
        what the dimension configuration. It provides layout helpers similar to the format of a newspaper and is used the world over to format the display of content.</p>

        <p>React comes to us from the minds at Facebook. It is the technology used to create the highly interactive web based components used on the Facebook website.
        It has proven to turn common conventions on their heads and still come out ahead of the pack. We think React is the future of teh web.</p>

        <%= image_tag image_path("rails-heading.png"), class: "img-responsive center-block",
            height: "100px", width: "200px"%>
        <p>Ruby on Rails provides an excellent backend framework for websites with a lot of data entry going on. It accels at allowing Developers to quickly pump out
        prototype applications as well as powering huge websites with millions of users. It marries React very nicely and can be used as a json api server.</p>

      <h2>Devschool Online Developer Bootcamp FAQ</h2>

      <p>You want a career that is interesting, safe, and makes money. To do that you
        need skills. But what skills? In what order? How much do you you need to learn of
        each one before you can a job that pays more then promises?</p>

      <p>My teaching style is to get you directly into real web development where you have no
        training wheels to get used to. That means before we can even talk about learning
        to build Web Applications we need an editor to edit the "code".</p>

      <h3>Q. What text editor will I learn at Devschool?</h3>

      <p>A. We start you off learning Vim. It is extremely powerful and more importantly,
        better suited in our opinion than anything else to write web based software, which
        is what we are talking about here! Is is great for working on files both locally
        and on remote machines out there in the interwebs. Sublime can't do that!</p>

      <h3>Q. What front-end web developer skills will I learn?</h3>

      <p>A. The backbone and foundation of the Internet is HTML and more recently, HTML5. HTML
         is the structure of the webpage, but you also need some style. That is where CSS
         and again, more recently, CSS3 comes into play. You 'put' an element on a page 
         (like a unordered list) with HTML, you make it look pretty with CSS.</p>

      <p>But there is more to it then just the languages. We also need a font-end framework
         to equalize out all the various differences in browsers and computers. We need
         something that will allow the pages we build respond to changes, like when we
         flip our phones or tablets from vertical to horizontal. Or to just deal with the
         myriad of screen sizes available.</p>

      <p>That is where Twitter's Bootstrap front-end framework comes in. We teach you the
         nitty gritty of responsive design using bootstrap and tools like Masonry, which
         is how Pinterest gets such awesome looking flowing pages!.</p>

      <h3>Q. Can I use Windows to learn Web development at Devschool?</h3>

      <p>A. Sorry, we are no longer advising people to run virtual machines with Linux inside
        Windows. It is slow and another nightmare you don't need right now. You want
        to be snappy. You want the largest pool of possible support help sources and that]
        means OSX or Linux.</p>

      <p>Windows does not support the same libraries as the other two, and it doesn't share
         the same architecture. In short Windows speaks a language the other two do not, while
         Linux and OSX both agree to support much of UNIX.</p>

      <h3>Q. What kind of computer do you recommend for Desvchool?</h3>

      <p>A. Our own statistics show: Mac OSX users have the smoothest web development experience
        with the tools you will learn here. That being said, we also love Linux if it is
        run Native nd the person wants a real software education.</p>

      <p>Ubuntu and Mint are popular choices for those who want to strut their kneckbeards,
        be they man, be they woman. Both Linux and OSX are built on the foundations of
        UNIX.</p>

      <h3>Q. What kind of Database systems will I learn at Devschool?</h3>

      <p>A. Most web applications are a collection of Create, Read, Update, and Delete events,
        also known as CRUD. This implies there will be a Database in use, and we teach
        and promote both Postgresql and Mongo and Redis depending on the task at hand.</p>

      <h3>Q. What about Server-side frameworks?</h3>

      <p>A. Ruby is commonly listed as the second most listed language in all
      open source job postings. Ruby on Rails is a web framework specifically
      designed to help you get things done quickly. What kind of things? 
      Web development things!</p>

      <h3>Q. Will I learn JavaScript at Devschool?</h3>

      <p>A. JavaScript is a scripting lanaguge built into every browser on the market today.
        Any "rich application" features that are interactive without a page-load, yep that was
        our friend JavaScript. We teach jQuery, along with 'vanilla' JavaScript and also
        ReactJS.</p>

      <h3>Q. What about Payment processing chat apps and things like that?</h3>

      <p>A. To be an effective developer you need to know a good measure of all of these things to
        be a candidate worth hiring. And that means a candidate who can wrangle all these tools
        and languages into technology solutions for buisinesses.</p>

      <p>Along the way you will learn how to leverage 
      <a rel="nofollow" href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe for payments</a>
      to accept payments, and how to build real time apps like chat, backend management 
      apps, statistics gathering and chart displays, and anything else that comes up 
      when you are building a real app over a span of months or more.</p>

      <p>You will also learn about deployment and setup and DNS at 
      <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heroku.com">Heroku for simple deployment</a>,
      <a rel="nofollow" href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services (AWS) for professional-grade services</a>, and
      <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloufFlare for DNS and site speed</a>.</p>

      <p>It is a lot to learn, but our job is to guide you through it, so you learn what you need
      to know, and not get bogged down in the things that might not matter. You can think of
      the Devschool online developer bootcamp like your technology education flashlight in the dark!</p>
